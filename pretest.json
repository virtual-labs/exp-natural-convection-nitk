        "a": "The right answer is (c). Radiation is the mode of heat transfer using electromagnetic waves.",
        "b": "The right answer is (c). Conduction is a mode of heat transfer in solid which the heat flows in solid from hotter region to colder region.",
        "c": "Correct, the right answer is (c). It is convection i.e. conduction plus some velocity. It is the process of energy transport affected by the mixing of a fluid medium.",
        "d": "The right answer is (c). Heat exchanger is a device used to remove or apply the heat from one material to another material. Example, evaporator and condensator."

        "a": "The right answer is (d). Convection is a process in which thermal energy is transferred between solid and fluid flowing through it and radiation is the mode of heat transfer using electromagnetic waves. Since a finned tube hot water radiator with a fan blowing air over, conduction happens but radiation mode doesn't happen.",
